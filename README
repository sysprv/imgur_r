This is a simple Python script to download images from imgur.com
galleries that are related to subreddits.

For example, images uploaded to reddit.com/r/pics/ should also be
available from imgur.com/r/pics/.

This script uses JSON metadata from imgur, downloading the images and
storing the metadata in a SQLite3 database.

As it is now, this script is not very user friendly. Image files are
saved to the current directory with only the imgur hash used as the
filename. It should be trivial to use the metadata from the SQLite3
database to create some user-friendly facade.

Error handling in the script is sufficient, but is not air-tight.

This script expects Python 3.2.x.


Usage

    python imgur_r.py /r/awww

This will create a SQLite3 database in the current directory, named
"imgur_r_awww.sqlite3", and will start downloading images.

Note that imgur metadata only contains images going back a few months.
This means that this script may not download all images that are linked
from the subreddit.


Closed Connections

When fetching metadata, imgur seems to drop the http connection. In this
case, this script will close http connections to imgur, wait 10 seconds,
initialise connections once more, and attempt to continue from where it
left off.
